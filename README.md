# RomCom  

### Abstract:
Who doesn't love a good romance novel? The first thing to grab your attention is the cover. We have developed a website where you can create your own romance novel cover. Using JavaScript, in conjunction with CSS and HTML, we created functionality that allows the user to generate, save, and view random and user-generated covers. Using the navigation bar, the user can easily move among the home view, create your own cover view, and saved cover view. In addition, the user can delete covers from the saved covers section.

### Installation Instructions:
- Clone this repo to your local computer
- Open in your text editor
- Read the README.md
- In the terminal run the command open index.html for initial deployment and interaction with app

### Preview of App:

### Context:
This was our first collaborative project at Turing after only one full week of learning. We had five days to work on the project, while also balancing our courses, meetings, and other assignments. Check out the project specifications [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/romcom-pair-v2.html).

### Learning Goals:
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
  - Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
  - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Write code collaboratively
  - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
  - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

###Technology Used
- Atom
- HTML
- CSS
- Chrome Dev Tools
- JavaScript
- Github

### Wins
- Collaboration was highly effective, as we honored the DTR throughout the project, making adjustments as necessary and pre-planned and calendared all collaborative work sessions in advance of writing code
- Deepened our understanding of the Github workflow and learned to create more meaningful branch names, commit messages, and pull requests through each iteration of the project
- Deepened our understanding of collaboratively reading and writing code, understanding the difference between updating our data model (saved covers array) and updating the DOM (what is displayed for the user), and using query selectors and event listeners in JavaScript to create web page functionality
- Learning how to use JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the inner text of the HTML rather than modifying the HTML file itself

### Challenges
- Newness of collaborative Github workflow was challenging at first, but both partners eventually gained confidence in using it effectively
- Deleting covers functionality in Iteration 4 proved to be a challenge but after some independent research, multiple attempts, and support from another student in our cohort, we achieved full functionality.
